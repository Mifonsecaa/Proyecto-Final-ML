we collect high resolution images using different drone platform spanning a large geographic area and introduce a multi-View dataset for vehicle detection in complex Scenarios using Aerial Images (VSAI), which features arbitrary view aerial images consisted of different types of complex real-world scenes. The imagery in our dataset is captured with a wide variety of camera angles, flight heights, time, weather conditions, and illumination. VSAI contains 49,712 vehicle instances annotated with oriented bounding boxes and arbitrary quadrilateral bounding boxes (47,519 small vehicles and 2193 large vehicles), and we also annotate the occlusion rate of the objects to further increase the generalization ability of object detection networks.
